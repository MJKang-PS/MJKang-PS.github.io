I am an M.A. student in International Relations and Political Science at Seoul National University.
My research focuses on nuclear strategy, alliance politics, and signaling theory, with particular
interest in how states communicate resolve and deterrence through military and political signals.

Methodologically, I am interested in text-as-data approaches and mixed-method research designs,
including discourse analysis and quantitative modeling of strategic behavior.
